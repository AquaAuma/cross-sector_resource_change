# national exposure to cross-sector climate impacts

Code and analysis on short-term and long-term exposure to climate change across sectors of fisheries, water, and agriculture related to the following manuscript: 
Maureaud A. et al. *National exposure to gradual and sudden cross-sector climate impacts in a world connected by trade*

Project aim: assess the cross-sector exposure to shocks and long-term change in water, agriculture, and fisheries resources from climate change and how they challenge current international trade and governance structures.

Data from the [ISIMIP project](https://www.isimip.org).

This project is a product of the Minerva grant ["Climate Change and Great Power Competition"](https://minerva.defense.gov/Research/Funded-Projects/Article/2957063/climate-change-and-great-power-competition/).

## Structure of the repository

-   **code/** contains the R code files to process the ISIMIP simulations, explore methods, apply calculations to the data, produce figures, and conduct supplementary analyses
-   **data/** contains the primary data files used in the project as well as the processed data files.
-   **functions/** contains the generic functions to complete the data processing
-   **figures/** contains the generated figures

## Primary data sources

-   The ISIMIP data files are not stored on this repository as ISIMIP has its own repository and data policy (see the [ISIMIP open repository and data policy](https://www.isimip.org/gettingstarted/data-access/)). For this project, the ISIMIP simulations were obtained by requesting access to the [DKRZ server](https://www.isimip.org/dashboard/accessing-isimip-data-dkrz-server/) in agreement with the project coordinators. Additional crop files were accessed on demand by requesting Jonas JÃ¤germeyr.
-   The EEZ land union shapefile is open access and available on the [marine regions website](https://www.marineregions.org/downloads.php), and the most recent version was used (version 3 released in 2020).
-   The data on regional trade agreements was accessed on the World Trade Organization (WTO) website, and downloaded on April 2024.

## Processed data access

-   **data/data_processing**: processed data files by sector and aggregation scale

-   **data/long-term_change**: probabilities data files by aggregation scale and metric type

-   **data/short-term_change**: probabilities data files by aggregation scale and metric type
